# Sample Code for Proving Property (T) via Semidefinte Programming
Here we have MatLab and Mathematica code proving Kazhdan's Property (T) for $SL_3(\mathbb{Z})$ via Semidefinite Methods. This accompanies Chapter 5 of my senior thesis titled \textit{Applications of Semidefinite Programming and Multiplicative Weights in Proving Kazhdanâ€™s Property (T).}

Instructions:

1. Install SeDuMi and YalMip.
2. Run SL3PrePostProcess.nb up until the line delta to disk.
3. Run Position_and_Laplacian.ipynb
4. Run SL3SDP.mlx on MatLab.
5. Run the rest of SL3PrePostProcess.nb

We thank Tim Netzer and Andreas Thom (the authors of the 2015 paper \textit{Kazhdan's Property (T) via Semidefinite Optimization}), who wrote the Mathematica code that I modified and supplemented with the MatLab Program and IPython Notebook.
