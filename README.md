# Sample Code for Property (T) via Semidefinte Programming
Here we have MatLab and Mathematica code proving Kazhdan's Property (T) for $SL_3(\mathbb{Z})$ via Semidefinite Methods. This accompanies Chapter 5 of my senior thesis titled \textit{Applications of Semidefinite Programming and Multiplicative Weights in Proving Kazhdanâ€™s Property (T).}

Instructions:

1. Install SeDuMi and YalMip.
2. Run SL3PrePostProcess.nb up until the line delta to disk.
3. Run Position_and_Laplacian.ipynb
4. Run SL3SDP.mlx
5. Run the rest of SL3PrePostProcess.nb

Credit is given to Tim Netzer and Andreas Thom whose code I modified to create SL3PrePostPRocess.nb.
